The nth bit corresponds to whether the basis element e_n is used to  construct the element with the given index.\n\nAs an example, in the algebra of physical space, the element e₁ can be represented with the binary number 0b001, e₂ with 0b010, and e₃ with 0b100. Elements of higher grades can be accessed by using the xor operation: for example, the basis bivector e₁e₃ can be represented with xor(0b001, 0b100) == 0b101. The scalar element is always represented with 0.\n\nThe sign of the index is stored. A negative sign corresponds to an odd permutation of the basis elements, and \n\nThe QuadraticForm is a tag that marks the Clifford algebra associated with the index. All operations on such BitIndex only depend on the value modulo elements(Cl). If a generic index is desired, QuadraticForm may be used as the tag.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#CliffordNumbers.BitIndices","page":"Home","title":"CliffordNumbers.BitIndices","text":"BitIndices{Cl<:QuadraticForm}\n\nStores the range of valid BitIndices for the Clifford algebra with quadratic form Cl.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#CliffordNumbers.CliffordNumber","page":"Home","title":"CliffordNumbers.CliffordNumber","text":"CliffordNumber{Cl,T,L}\n\nAn element of a Clifford algebra, often referred to as a multivector, with quadratic form Cl,  element type T, and length L (which depends entirely on Cl).\n\nThe coefficients are ordered by taking advantage of the natural binary structure of the basis. The grade of an element is given by the Hamming weight of its index. For the algebra of physical space, the order is: 1, e₁, e₂, e₁₂, e₃, e₁₃, e₂₃, e₁₂₃ = i. This order allows for more aggressive SIMD optimization when calculating the geometric product.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#CliffordNumbers.PGA2D","page":"Home","title":"CliffordNumbers.PGA2D","text":"PGA3D\n\nProjective geometric algebra of 2 dimensions and 1 projective dimension, Cl(2,0,1).
