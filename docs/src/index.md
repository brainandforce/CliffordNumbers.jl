# CliffordNumbers

[CliffordNumbers.jl](https://github.com/brainandforce/CliffordNumbers.jl) is a package that
provides fully static multivectors (Clifford numbers) in arbitrary dimensions and metrics. While
in many cases, sparse representations of multivectors are more efficient, for spaces of low
dimension, dense static representations may provide a performance and convenience advantage.
